# my-enviro-monitor
My desktop Pimoroni Enviro Monitor to track temperature, light, humidty and pressure. As a bonus it warns me when I am too loud again.

There is also a folder with some the icons I am using.

Some notes:
There seem to be some issues with the st7735 library ("https://github.com/pimoroni/st7735-python")
